## Dataset from awesome-datascience GitHub:

[clothing-dataset](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset)

This data set includes more than 5000 images of clothing. As someone with an interest in data analytics, who also minored in Fashion in my undergraduate institution, trend forecasting is of great interest to me. This data set could have interesting applications within the use of AI and machine learning for different aspects of fashion forecasting. Tools could be utilized to gather/make predictions about data from the images such as fabrics, colors, and overall trends. This data could then be used to make product decisions for businesses in the fashion industry.

## Book from free-data-science-book GitHub

[plotting and visualization in python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/fonnesbeck/5850463/raw/a29d9ffb863bfab09ff6c1fc853e1d5bf69fe3e4/3.+Plotting+and+Visualization.ipynb)

I chose “Plotting and Visualization in Python”, which has no author specified. The webpage discusses the fundamentals of using the Python libraries matplotlib and pandas to create data visualizations such as graphs and plots. I’m interested in this book because the majority of my data visualization experience has been with Tableau and similar platforms, to create complex, dynamic dashboards. I want to improve my skills within Python visualization so that I can make simple, agile plots to get a quick view of different relationships within the data.
